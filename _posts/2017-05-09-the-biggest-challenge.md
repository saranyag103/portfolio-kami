title: The Biggest Challenges while Learning to Develop
---

One of the biggest challenges for me is continuing to be persistent when trying
to figure out why the code isn't working. It's really easy to want to give up
immediately, but that feeling after successfully debugging something makes it
worth all the effort.  I think it's similar to how runners hit their second
wind to endure to win even when they're exhausted.

Another challenge I've faced - Angular, my number one enemy!!! Just kidding haha.
I did struggle with Angular because the errors aren't super helpful in
pinpointing the location of where the actual mistake in the code might be,
but the more I dealt with Angular the easier it became. For example, I was able
to debug some of the Angular issues in Bloc Chat because I recognized the errors
from my experience while working on Bloc Jams Angular.  I think the best way for
me to get better with Angular is to read up on it a little more to completely
grasp it all.
