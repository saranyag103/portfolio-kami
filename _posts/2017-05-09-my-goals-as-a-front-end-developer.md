title: My Goals as a Frontend Developer
---

I think my ultimate goal as a developer is to create something amazing with my
own hands. Looking back at all the projects I've made so far makes me feel
excited to continue building projects. I really want to be a part of a
startup that makes something really crazy and useful to people's lives.  
I'm not the most creative person around, but I'm totally ok with being the worker
bee type who codes a ton to make a cool idea into a reality.
