title: My Experience at Bloc
---

Although everyone always says college is supposed to be the best time in one's
life, I was deeply unsatisfied with my college education and the experience
overall. I chose to major in psychology and minor in english
(a real snoozefest!) only to realize during my last semester of college that I
absolutely hated the idea of working in that field.

Luckily Bloc saved me from an unsatisfying career and a life
filled with regret! I'm super happy to be able to learn all that I have so far
and blessed to have a cool mentor (shout out to Jesse :D) to guide me down this
path.  Although it's not always easy, I've got a strong resolve to keep pushing
forward and improve as much as I can.
