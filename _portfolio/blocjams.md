## Explanation
BlocJams is music streaming site built with Javascript and JQuery.ã€€The user can, play, pause, skip backwards, skip forwards, and control the volume within the player bar.  The player bar also updates the time, song title, and artist name as it plays through the album.  

## Problem
My main objective for this project was to create a website while honing my skills as a developer.

## Solution
BlocJams allows the user to navigate between its landing page, collection page, and album page.  The landing page displays the selling points of using the service.  The collection page and album page is where the actual streaming happens.  The collection page displays all the albums in the user's collection library.  When the user clicks on an album in the collection, the album information and a list of its songs are displayed.  The player bar located at the bottom of the page, allows the user to control their music by playing, pausing, skipping, or increasing the volume.

## Conclusion
After this project, I acquired a more solid understanding of web development using Javascript and JQuery.
