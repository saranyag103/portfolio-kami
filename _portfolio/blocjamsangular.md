## Explanation
BlocJams Angular is a rebuild of my previous project BlocJams built with AngularJS.

## Problem
The purpose of the rebuild was to explore the possibilities of using AngularJS.

## Solution
Rebuilding BlocJams as a single page application has

## Results
In comparison to the first build, the single page application version of Bloc Jams allows the user to more easily move about the streaming service without interrupting the music that is already playing.  The user can browse their collection while still able to play, pause, skip, and control the volume.

## Conclusion
In my exploration of the framework I have learned that AngularJS definitely has a lot to offer, but it is definitely less forgiving than plain Javascript in terms of errors.  All in all, rebuilding the project to dip my feet into Angular was a rewarding experience.
